# social_network_api

## Description
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

This back-end application allows users to connect with friends to share their thoughts and reactions.

## How it looks
Videos walking through functionality using Insomnia, can be downloaded raw and are found in the ![videos folder](https://github.com/sper0054/social_network_api/tree/main/videos)

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This requires MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js, and Insomnia to test the API.
