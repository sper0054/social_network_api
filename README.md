# social_network_api

## Description
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

This back-end application allows users to connect with friends to share their thoughts and reactions.

## How it looks
Videos demoing functionality using Insomnia, can be found in the image folder in the repository.
